========

This is a repository for Miquelon/Of Fish &amp; Chips, a simple shooter project written in C# using Monogame.

To simply play the game, download Setup.zip here: http://sdrv.ms/12sEubT.

To develop this project further, you will need:
- Visual Studio
- OpenAL
- XNA or Windows Phone SDK (Basically, any mean to generate *.xnb files). If you want to reuse the game's asset, you do not need this. (But who wants to get stuck with poorly drawn mathematical symbol?)
